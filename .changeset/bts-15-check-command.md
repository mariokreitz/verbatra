Add a read-only `check` command and the matching SDK `check()` surface. `verbatra check` reports, per target locale, how many keys are missing (present in the source, absent from the target), how many are stale (the source changed since the target was last translated), and how many are up to date. It calls no provider, needs no API key, writes no files, and never touches the lock.

Exit codes make it CI-friendly: `0` when every locale is in sync, `1` when at least one locale has a missing or stale key (the full per-locale report is still printed), and `2` when the run could not start (a structured error to stderr, with stdout left clean for `--json` piping). Flags mirror the other commands: `--cwd`, `--config`, `--locales`, and `--json` (the JSON form is the SDK `CheckSummary` verbatim).

The SDK exposes `check(input, deps?)` returning a `CheckSummary` of `{ inSync, locales }`, where each `LocaleCheckSummary` carries `{ locale, missing, stale, upToDate, inSync }`. It reuses the existing source read, adapter selection, lock baseline, and core `diffResources`, so there is one definition of drift in the codebase.
